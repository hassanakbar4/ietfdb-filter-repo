<       hijacked the old session?  When the client detects that a new
<       principal, Bob, wants to use the session, it SHOULD have sent a
<       SET_SSV, which leads to the following sub-scenarios:
< 
<       *  Let us suppose that from the rogue connection, Eve sent a
<          SET_SSV with the same slot ID and sequence ID that the
<          legitimate client later uses.  The server will assume the
<          SET_SSV sent with Bob's credentials is a retry, and return to
<          the legitimate client the reply it sent Eve.  However, unless
<          Eve can correctly guess the SSV the legitimate client will use,
<          the digest verification checks in the SET_SSV response will
<          fail.  That is an indication to the client that the session has
<          apparently been hijacked.
< 
<       *  Alternatively, Eve sent a SET_SSV with a different slot ID than
<          the legitimate client uses for its SET_SSV.  Then the digest
<          verification of the SET_SSV sent with Bob's credentials fails
<          on the server, and the error returned to the client makes it
<          apparent that the session has been hijacked.
< 
<       *  Alternatively, Eve sent an operation other than SET_SSV, but
<          with the same slot ID and sequence that the legitimate client
<          uses for its SET_SSV.  The server returns to the legitimate
<          client the response it sent Eve.  The client sees that the
