Subject: Interim Meeting for IMAPEXT 
Date: Tue, 21 Dec 2004 14:31:05 -0500 
========================================
We are organizing an interim meeting for IMAPEXT in the San Francisco
Bay Area for the afternoon of Jan 20. (The meeting location and time
will be alongside the LEMONADE WG interim meeting which has an
overlapping membership).

I've already announced this intent on the IMAPEXT mailing list and
would like to announce it more widely even though we don't as yet know
the exact location.

Scott Hollenbeck has indicated his approval.

Location: TBD, near San Francisco/Redwood Shores, CA
Date: Jan 20, 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm
Hotel: See LEMONADE WG interim meeting information

Agenda (Draft)
===========
- resolve ANNOTATE open issues with authors
- Discuss LISTEXT extensions
- Resume work on ACL draft
