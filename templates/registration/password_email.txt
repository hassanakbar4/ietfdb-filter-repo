Hi,

  Someone gave this email address as theirs when requesting a
password change or new account at datatracker.ietf.org .  If that
was you, please visit this URL to continue the process:

http://{{ site.name }}{% url ietf.ietfauth.views.password_return %}?timestamp={{ timestamp }}&email={{ email|urlencode }}&hash={{ hash }}

  This link is valid for {{ days }} days.

  If that someone wasn't you, then you can safely ignore this email,
assuming that you're reading it in a way that isn't easily sniffed.
