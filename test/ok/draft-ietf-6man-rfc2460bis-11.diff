<       o  Expanded Addressing Capabilities
< 
<          IPv6 increases the IP address size from 32 bits to 128 bits, to
<          support more levels of addressing hierarchy, a much greater
<          number of addressable nodes, and simpler auto-configuration of
<          addresses.  The scalability of multicast routing is improved by
<          adding a "scope" field to multicast addresses.  And a new type
<          of address called an "anycast address" is defined, used to send
<          a packet to any one of a group of nodes.
< 
<       o  Header Format Simplification
< 
<          Some IPv4 header fields have been dropped or made optional, to
<          reduce the common-case processing cost of packet handling and
<          to limit the bandwidth cost of the IPv6 header.
< 
<       o  Improved Support for Extensions and Options
< 
<          Changes in the way IP header options are encoded allows for
<          more efficient forwarding, less stringent limits on the length
<          of options, and greater flexibility for introducing new options
<          in the future.
< 
<       o  Flow Labeling Capability
< 
<          A new capability is added to enable the labeling of sequences
<          of packets that the sender requests to be treated in the
<          network as a single flow.
< 
<       o  Authentication and Privacy Capabilities
