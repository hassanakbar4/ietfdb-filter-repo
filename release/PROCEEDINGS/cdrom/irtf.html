<h2>5 IRTF</h2>
<h2>IRTF Mission</h2>

<p><em>To promote research of importance to the evolution of the future Internet by
creating focused, long-term and small Research Groups working on topics related to
Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology.</em></p>

<H2>IRTF Research Groups</h2>
<p>The Internet Research Task Force is composed of a number
of small <a href="http://www.irtf.org/groups.html">Research Groups</a>. Research Groups are usually focussed and long term, though short lived "task force" like Research Groups are possible.<p>

<h2>IRTF Overview</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.irtf.org/groups.html">Research Groups</a> work on topics related to
Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology. Research Groups are
expected to have the stable long term (with respect to the lifetime of the Research Group) membership needed to promote the development of
research collaboration and teamwork in exploring research issues. Participation is by
individual contributors, rather than by representatives of organizations. </p>

<p>The IRTF is managed by the IRTF Chair in consultation with the Internet Research
Steering Group (IRSG). The IRSG membership includes the IRTF Chair, the chairs of the
various Research Group and possibly other individuals ("members at large") from
the research community. </p>

<p>The IRTF Chair is appointed by the <a href="http://www.iab.org/">Internet
Architecture Board (IAB)</a>, the Research Group chairs are appointed as part of the
formation of Research Groups and the IRSG members at large are chosen by the IRTF Chair in
consultation with the rest of the IRSG and on approval of the IAB. In addition to managing
the Research Groups, the IRSG may from time to time hold topical workshops focusing on
research areas of importance to the evolution of the Internet, or more general workshops
to, for example, discuss research priorities from an Internet perspective. </p>

<p>The IRTF Research Groups guidelines and procedures are described more fully in 
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2014.txt">RFC 2014 (BCP 8)</a>.</p>
