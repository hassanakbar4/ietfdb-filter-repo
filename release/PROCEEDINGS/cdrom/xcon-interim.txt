Below, find a revised agenda for the interim meeting this week. Note
that some of the later topics rely on the outcome of the
Framework/Model/Terminology discussion, so the overall agenda may be
significantly revised after those topics. This dependency means that the
framework discussion will likely be allowed to go as long as necessary
to reach fundamental conclusions, even if doing so pushes other items
off the agenda.
