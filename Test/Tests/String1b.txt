In <xref target="RFC8032"/> the elliptic curve signature system Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) is described along with a recommendation for the use of the curve25519 and curve448.  EdDSA has defined two modes: the PureEdDSA mode without prehashing and the HashEdDSA mode with prehashing.  The convention used for identifying the algorithm/curve combinations is to use "Ed25519" and "Ed448" for the PureEdDSA mode.  This document does not provide the conventions needed for the prehash versions of the signature algorithm.  The use of the OIDs is described for public keys, private keys and signatures.
