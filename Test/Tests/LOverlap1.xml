<!--Begin DNE text -->
<t>The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
architecture.
<!--End DNE text -->
The investigated topics often require coordinated
efforts from many organizations and industry bodies to improve an
identified problem.  One of the targets of the workshops is to
establish communication between relevant organizations, especially
when the topics are out of the scope of the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF).
<!--Begin DNE text -->
This long-term planning function of the IAB is
complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
groups of the IETF.
<!--End DNE text -->
</t>

<t>With the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), interoperability
becomes more and more important. Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs)
have done a tremendous amount of work to standardize new protocols
and profile existing protocols.</t>

<t>At the application layer and at the level of solution frameworks, 
interoperability is not yet mature. Particularly, the
work on data formats (in the form of data models and information
models) has not seen the same level of consistency throughout
SDOs.</t>

<t>One common problem is the lack of an encoding-independent standardization
of the information, the so-called information model. Another problem is
the strong relationship between data formats and the underlying communication architecture, 
such as a design in Remote Procedure Call (RPC) style or a RESTful design (where REST refers to Representational State Transfer). Furthermore, groups develop solutions that are very similar on the surface but differ slightly in their standardized outcome, leading to interoperability
problems. Finally, some groups favor different encodings for use with
various application-layer protocols.</t>

<t>Thus, the IAB decided to organize a workshop to reach out to relevant
stakeholders to explore the state of the art and identify
commonality and gaps <xref target="IOTSIAG"/><xref target="IOTSIWS"/>. In particular, the IAB was
interested to learn about the following aspects:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>What is the state of the art in data and information models? What should
an information model look like?</t>
  <t>What is the role of formal languages, such as schema languages, in
describing information and data models?</t>
  <t>What is the role of metadata, which is attached to data to make it self-describing?</t>
  <t>How can we achieve interoperability when different organizations, companies,
and individuals develop extensions?</t>
  <t>What is the experience with interworking various data models developed
from different groups, or with data models that evolved over time?</t>
  <t>What functionality should online repositories for sharing schemas have?</t>
  <t>How can existing data models be mapped against each other to offer interworking?</t>
  <t>Is there room for harmonization, or are the use cases of different groups
and organizations so unique that there is no possibility for cooperation?</t>
  <t>How can organizations better work together to increase awareness and information sharing?</t>

<title>On the Difference between Information Models and Data Models</title>

<abstract><t>There has been ongoing confusion about the differences between Information Models and Data Models for defining managed objects in network management.  This document explains the differences between these terms by analyzing how existing network management model specifications (from the IETF and other bodies such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) or the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)) fit into the universe of Information Models and Data Models. This memo documents the main results of the 8th workshop of the Network Management Research Group (NMRG) of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) hosted by the University of Texas at Austin.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
