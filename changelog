ietfdb (3.00.01)

  * First public draft for comments.  Does not cover ballots, 
    IPR, meetings, announcements or liaisons.

  * _A lot_ of various special-purpose tables has been
    eliminated, and replaced by document-history and group-history
    tables.  The same is true for a lot of date/time fields in old
    tables.

  * This version replaces 35 tables in the previous version with
    9 main tables, plus 7 auxiliary tables which provide names for
    states etc. (DocState, DocType, GroupState, ...)
