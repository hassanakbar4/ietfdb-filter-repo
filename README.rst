Internet-Draft text to XML Conversion Tool
==========================================

This tool, 'id2xml', is indended for use by the RFC-Editor staff, in order to
produce a first xml2rfc-compatible XML version from text-only internet draft
submissions.  The XML follows RFC 7749 [1]_ in version 1.x of the tool, and
will follow RFC 7991 [2]_ in version 2.x, which will be released once support
is available to process XML sources which follows the RFC 7991 vocabulary.

id2xml may also be useful for Internet-Draft authors who wish to start working
on a new version of an older draft or RFC, for which no xml2rfc-compatible XML
source is available.

The releases of the 0.x release series are preview releases, with a number of known
deficiencies.  They are released in order that potential users may provide
feedback on the most desired improvements ahead of a 1.0.0 release.
